                In the Fall of 2024, I had the opportunity to work as a co-op student on the Technical Account Management
                Team at Pepper. In this report, I will reflect on my time at this company and give an overview of
                the work I accomplished during this term.

                Pepper provides a white-label eCommerce solution for independent food distributors serving businesses
                such as restaurants, schools, and retail stores. Founded in 2019, Pepper has grown to a team of approximately
                150 employees, supporting distributors across Australia, the United States, and Canada. Notably, one of these
                distributors serves several Canadian universities, including the University of Guelph, where I study. The company
                is based in New York, but also has an office in Toronto, with most employees working remotely.

            <p>
                At Pepper, I worked on the Technical Account Management Team, supporting a variety of distributors organized within a tiered system.
                Tier 0 to Tier 2 distributors were assigned dedicated team members, while Tier 3 and 4 distributors were addressed as lower-priority
                tasks. My primary focus was on Tier 3 and 4 distributors, where I assisted with technical support requests and implemented changes
                to their integration logic to meet their needs.
                <br><br>
                I also participated in the Operations On-Call program, which ensured food orders synced correctly between Pepper and distributors’
                systems. My contributions included writing comprehensive documentation for addressing sync errors across different distributors and
                actively monitoring and resolving these issues during business hours.
                <br><br>
                Midway through my term, our team transitioned into two specialized groups: support and project management. This restructure was
                designed to scale support services in response to the rapid growth of our customer base. During this shift, I helped pilot the Tier
                1 Support Team, working alongside two colleagues to handle incoming support requests. We resolved simple issues and triaged complex
                cases to either the Tier 2 support team or the Project Management team, ensuring efficient and effective customer service.

                <li>Develop a strong understanding of Pepper's tech stack</li>

                <p>
                    During my time at Pepper, I developed proficiency with a variety of tools used for modern software development
                    and support. I gained experience writing SQL queries to navigate and analyze a large, complex database with multiple
                    different tables. I used Git regularly for version control within a shared codebase, ensuring efficient collaboration.
                    Additionally, I learned to use Sentry for monitoring and diagnosing errors in production code and Jira for organizing and
                    managing work tasks. These skills have equipped me with confidence and practical expertise that will support my future career
                    ambitions.

                <br>
                <p>
                    One of my primary goals while working on the Technical Account Management Team was to actively contribute to tasks involving 
                    Pepper's codebase. During my co-op term, I had the opportunity to make a range of changes, from small tweaks to distributor 
                    integrations to larger projects, such as reworking the pricing logic for a distributor. These experiences gave me valuable 
                    insights into working with production code that processes data from various sources, transforming it into a consistent format 
                    suitable for integration into Pepper's app.

                <li>Adapt effectively to remote work and establish productive work-from-home habits</li>
                <br>
                <p>
                    During my time at Pepper, I successfully adapted to working remotely and developed habits that enhanced my productivity in 
                    a work-from-home environment. I created daily routine, set up a dedicated workspace, and utilized online tools such as Slack and Google
                    meet to stay organized and connected with my team. Clear communication and proactive collaboration became essential in this setting, 
                    allowing me to contribute effectively despite the physical distance. These skills have prepared me to navigate remote work 
                    environments confidently in the future.

                kindness as I learned to navigate this role and become an effective member of the team. Each team member generously took

                I want to extend a special thank you to Vivek, my supervisor, who consistently supported me throughout the term. He 
                provided valuable guidance, kept up with my work progress, and ensured I was involved in challenging and rewarding tasks.

                I also want to thank Anastasia, whom I worked closely with during the second half of my term. She offered me a platform to 
                provide feedback on the Tier 1 Support Team pilot and actively implemented the suggestions I shared, which was both 
                encouraging and rewarding.

                Additionally, I am grateful to the many individuals from external teams who demonstrated a strong commitment to delivering
