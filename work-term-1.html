                For the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to work as a co-op student on the Retail Helpline at Home Hardware.
                In this report, I will reflect on my time at this company and give an overview of some of the work I accomplished
                during this term.

                At Home Hardware, I was part of the Retail Helpline team, serving as the first point of contact for IT support
                requests from any of Home Hardware's 1,100 retail stores. My responsibilities included:<br><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assisting store owners with the initial installation of Home Hardware software and technological products</li>
                <li>Providing ongoing technical support for these products</li>
                <li>Research and documentation of store suggestions for software enhancements</li>
                <li>Assisting stores with maintaining computer hardware and operating system troubleshooting</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Familiarize myself with Home Hardware's retail applications</li>
                <p>
                    <br>I was eager to learn how different applications function within a real-world retail environment. I had the opportunity
                    to explore the inner workings of various applications supported by the Helpline, including SQL-based POS systems and
                    Android-based inventory management software. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain valuable insight into the 
                    framework of production-level applications.<br><br>
    
                </p>
                <li>Learn problem solving techniques for approaching complex service tickets</li>
                <p>
                    <br>A goal of mine while at Home Hardware was to learn how to dissect and approach a problem-solving scenario to resolve
                    service tickets efficiently. Throughout the summer I had the chance to face over 850 service tickets and work through 
                    the process of resolving each case. I learned the value of getting the context of the problem and ensuring I understood 
                    what the customer required. I learned how to apply critical thinking and make use of internal documentation to take steps
                    in solving the problem and I learned how to reach out for help when a problem could be better serviced by another one of
                    Home Hardware's internal teams.<br><br>
    
                </p>
                <li>Effective oral communication</li>
                <p>
                    <br>In this role, I gained a large amount of experience communicating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I
                    learned how to be clear and concise in my communication and the importance of keeping everyone looped in on all parts of
                    the problem-solving process. I learned how to work with difficult personalities and how to de-escalate scenarios where a
                    store owner or manager might be upset.<br><br>

                Overall I am extremely grateful for my time at Home Hardware. I was a part of a great team, who were all willing to step in
                and help with any questions I had. I had the chance to be a part of a very professional environment and learn different technical
                and non-technical skills required to work effectively in the workplace. I enjoyed learning about the different types of software
                used at Home Hardware and will take this valuable knowledge into future opportunities. Looking back on the term, it was a fulfilling
                and rewarding experience.

                I would like to thank everyone on the Retail Helpline team for making my time at Home Hardware a great learning experience. 
                Each team member was willing to help answer my questions and helped me through the beginning stages of this role. I would like 
                to thank Tracey who did a great job teaching me in the onboarding process and continued to assist when I needed help throughout 
                the term. I would also like to thank my manager Melanie who facilitated weekly team stand-ups and team training sessions, organized events, 
                and provided valuable feedback to me in this role.
